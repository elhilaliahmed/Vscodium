# Pogramming Methodology and Data Stuctures

 - The core idea behind this modules is to learn the techniques of ***problem solving***

## Example:
- Find the maximum of n integers

And algorithm to solve this problem would be:
```
    read(n)
    read(number)
    max = number
    loop: i = 2, n, 1
    ->
    read(number)
    if max < number
        max = number
    ->
    print(max)
```

## How did we solve that problem?


- Find the maximum in this list: {T1, T2, T3, ..., Tn}
- suppose our problem is {T1}, then the
